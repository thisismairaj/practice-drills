## About Practice Drill

My name is Mairaj Pirzada. I have a passion for new web technologies, HTML/CSS libraries & frameworks. That's why I gotta put my hands on whatever technology I can play with. To firmly grasp any web technology or CSS/JS library, I need to practice with it. Now, what if every library I explore, technology I play and the all the example code that goes into it, is pushed up to Github? The other like-minded people can see it, maybe use it to amplify their understanding of said technology? That'd be a win-win, right?

### *That's Why Practice Drill* ###

Every new technology I play with, there will be surely be code, examples and exercises. That code, those files will find their way into Practice Drill. Font Awesome, ReactJS, AngularJS, Vue.js, animate.css, WP Settings API, etc. are a few of the example libraries I am going to learn, play and **push**. Practice Drills will be pushed up to @thisismairaj (my Github). Follow me if you're into new web technologies! :)

## Contributing

First off, you should know that Practice Drills came into existence solely for my own practice. Sorry, but that's frankly the truth. But in coding industry, demonstrations of code pieces can always benefit others using the same technology. That's why I decided to put Practice Drills them up on Github, building my skillset as well as a boastful Github profile (evil smirk). If you found the Practice Drills useful, Star it, or fork it, it's no problem with me. It's all yours! :)
