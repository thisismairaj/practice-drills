## About WhatTheFlexbox

What The Flexbox is a series of video tutorials by @wesbos on the topic of CSS flexbox. It goes in depth, clears things and is designed with the beginners in mind. I am taking this course, and practising what it teaches. Aside from what it teaches, I try to add a bit of my own 'flavor', you know? The whattheflexbox files uploaded practice the course as well as other things I wanted to try, practice.
